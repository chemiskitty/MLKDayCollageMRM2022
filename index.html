                                <p>The Progress Pride Flag represents a shift towards inclusion that still speaks to the unique challenges of those with intersectional identities, but also affirms that progress and equity can only be actualized through unity.</p>
                                <p>The flag inspires me because it solidifies a sense of belonging for those of us who have been marginalized in and outside of the queer community, and there is an incredible power in belongingness that will continue to drive us forward.</p>
                                <p>As a queer, non-binary person, I am drawn to the color purple as a symbol of the female and male experiences in my identity and orientation. Also my headshot happened to be purple :)"</p>

Being out, vocal and visible (when you are able) helps our next generation know they are not alone!</p>

                                <p>What inspires me about the Progress Pride Flag is that we understand that it’s not fixed to a moment in time, but that we evolve over time and what the flag stands for must keep up with the people in which it represents.</p>

                                <p>Pride was started by a Black trans woman, but too often Black queer folks are marginalized by anti-Blackness in the broader LGBTQIA+ community. The Progress Pride Flag re-centers our story, our contributions, our presence. </p>

                    <h2>What does Pride Mean to You?</h2>
                    <p>The purpose of the Pride Flag has always been to make space and provide visibility to our beautiful and richly diverse community. This updated version, also called the The Progress Pride Flag, includes the traditional rainbow colors that have historically represented the LGBTQ+ community, with the addition of a black and brown stripe as well as the colors of the trans flag to be more inclusive of our intersectional and diverse communities, and emphasize the voices who most need to be heard. We’ve asked our LGBTQ+ team members and their allies to share what inspires them about the changes to the traditional Pride Flag, what makes them proud to be Out at IPG, and what excites them about the future of Pride. The responses you’ll find in this collage are a symbol of that dedication to make IPG a space where employees feel safe to be out, open, and authentically themselves at work.  </p>
                <p>We want to thank all of those who participated in this project by promoting this Pride Flag Collage in your networks and channels. Please feel free to link and share this collage and show your support for IPGLBTQ+!  </p>
